# Styling Guidelines

Internally, we define **default visual standards** for plots and figures. The main goals are:

- **clarity** – figures should be easy to interpret
- **consistency** – plots should look coherent across projects
- **reproducibility** – formatting choices should be deliberate and documented
- **publication-readiness** – figures should scale cleanly from reports to journal submissions

These recommendations aim to encourage good habits in everyday work and to reduce last-minute figure reformatting when preparing publications.

### General plotting guidelines

- [ ] **Use a sans-serif font type.** <br>
      Fonts like Arial or Helvetica are easier to read and are usually the font of choice for labels and annotations.

- [ ] **Use standard journal column widths.** <br>
      When preparing figures for scientific publications using standard widths (e.g. single or double column) is critical to make decisions on font size and aspect ratio.
  - Single-column: `89 mm`
  - Two-column: `183 mm`
- [ ] **Use an appropriate font size.** <br>
      Everything smaller than `7pt` this is usually too small for axis labels, tick labels, and legend text.
- [ ] **Use a neutral background.** <br>
      Usually a white or transparent background is best when exporting PNGs (e.g., for slides).
- [ ] **Avoid using borders and frames.** <br>
      Unless they are needed for clarity.
- [ ] **Use 4–6 tick labels or less.** <br>
      More ticks reduce clarity and add unnecessary detail.
- [ ] **Use detailed captions.** <br>
      The figure and caption should be understandable without referring back to the main text.

## Things to avoid

- **Avoid pie charts.**  
  Bar charts usually communicate the same information more clearly and comparably.

- **Avoid 3D charts.**  
  When rendered in 2D (e.g., in papers or slides), 3D visualizations are hard to read and can introduce ambiguity.

- **Avoid gridlines by default.**  
  Gridlines were historically used to assist manual interpretation.  
  In modern workflows, it is better to:
  - share the underlying dataset, and  
  - add gridlines only if they improve interpretability.
