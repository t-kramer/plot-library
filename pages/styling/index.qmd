# Styling Guidelines

These guidelines define the **default visual standards** for plots and figures in the CBE Building Science Plot Library.

The main goals are:

- **clarity** – figures should be easy to interpret
- **consistency** – plots should look coherent across projects
- **reproducibility** – formatting choices should be deliberate and documented
- **publication-readiness** – figures should scale cleanly from reports to journal submissions

These recommendations aim to encourage good habits in everyday work and to reduce last-minute figure reformatting when preparing publications.


## General plotting guidelines

- Use a **sans-serif font** (e.g., Arial or Helvetica) for all text in figures.
- Use **standard journal widths** when preparing figures for scientific publications:
  - Single-column: `89 mm`
  - Two-column: `183 mm`
- When using these standard widths, a **font size** of ~`7pt` is appropriate for axis labels, tick labels, and legend text.
- Use a **white background** for all plots.  
  A transparent background is also acceptable when exporting PNGs (e.g., for slides).
- For charts and plots, **avoid borders** unless needed for clarity.
- Use **no more than 4–6 tick labels** on each axis where possible.
- Include **detailed captions.**  
  The figure and caption should be understandable without referring back to the main text.

## Things to avoid

- **Avoid pie charts.**  
  Bar charts usually communicate the same information more clearly and comparably.

- **Avoid 3D charts.**  
  When rendered in 2D (e.g., in papers or slides), 3D visualizations are hard to read and can introduce ambiguity.

- **Avoid gridlines by default.**  
  Gridlines were historically used to assist manual interpretation.  
  In modern workflows, it is better to:
  - share the underlying dataset, and  
  - add gridlines only if they improve interpretability.
