title: "Plotting in Python"
---

This section focuses on **Python-based visualizations** for building science and indoor environmental quality data.

The examples in this library will mainly use:

- `matplotlib` as the core plotting engine
- `pandas` for data handling
- `seaborn` for high-level statistical plots where helpful
- `plotly` for interactive plots that are handy for web apps

---

## Core ideas

### 1. Data as DataFrames

Most examples assume:

- one row = one observation
- one column = one variable
- data stored as pandas DataFrames

Common preprocessing tasks before plotting:

- cleaning and filtering
- aggregation with groupby
- reshaping via melt() and pivot()

Clear data structure simplifies plotting code.

### 2. matplotlib as the foundation

There are two main ways to use matplotlib:

#### Stateful style (quick)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(x, y)
plt.xlabel("x")
plt.ylabel("y")
plt.title("Example")
plt.show()
```

#### Object-oriented style (recommended)

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_xlabel("x")
ax.set_ylabel("y")
ax.set_title("Example")
fig.tight_layout()
```

The object-oriented interface is more flexible and easier to reuse in real projects.

---

### 3. seaborn as a helper layer

`seaborn` simplifies many plot types:

- distributions
- regression plots
- categorical comparisons

Example:

```python
import seaborn as sns

sns.scatterplot(data=df, x="temp", y="comfort", hue="building")
```

`seaborn` uses `matplotlib` internally and can be customized the same way.

---

### 4. Styling and consistency

In `matplotlib`, visual defaults can be controlled globally:

```python
import matplotlib as mpl

mpl.rcParams["figure.figsize"] = (8, 5)
mpl.rcParams["font.size"] = 11
```

Later, a centralized style file (e.g. lab_style.mplstyle) can be created and reused.

---

### 5. Exporting figures

Always specify output format and quality:

```python
fig.savefig(
    "figures/example_plot.pdf",
    bbox_inches="tight",
    dpi=300
)
```

Guidelines:

- use PDF/SVG for vector output
- control figure size explicitly
- separate source code from output figures

---

### 6. Reproducibility principles

Good practice includes:

- version control (Git)
- scripts or notebooks that run top-to-bottom
- functions for repeated patterns
- avoidance of manual tweaks

Reusable helpers (e.g. plot helpers, style functions) lead to cleaner code and consistent figures.

---

## Where this Python section is going

Future additions may include:

- reusable plotting utilities
- standardized styling helpers
- Python/R side-by-side examples
- curated references and learning resources

The aim is to turn this into a living reference, not just static examples.
